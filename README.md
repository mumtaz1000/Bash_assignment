## Problems I face while doing this assignment
Issue 1: I got stuck for days on question 4.
Issue 2: I cannot live without my code editor or vs code. It was painful for me to write code on terminal then run it and then stop it to make the changes and wait to save and execute the code. For 1 file it is ok but not for 13 files.
In short I can write a blog on issues and problems I got while doing this assignment but honestly I like the assignment. It helps me to learn some new stuff and I learned some new commands.
